0.0.1
Initial revision.

0.0.2
Fixed symlinks in the distribution, relpaced them with files. The `libtoolize`
utility created the symlinks originally, so it was re-run with the -c option to
copy files instead of linking.

Updated README, it had bad information about documentation.

Uploaded a version of the API documentation online:

[interactive-mode branch]
Added support for interactive mode. Changed CDCLineBuffer so that it can support
input from any source, not just CDCFile. Added --interactive,-a command line
option to the cdctool program.
