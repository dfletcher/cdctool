-------
PURPOSE
-------

cdctool is a cross-platform serial tool for sending and receiving short
amounts of text from a serial connection.

When building devices with USB capable microcontrollers, a quick and simple
option for communicating with a host PC is to use CDC, a virtual serial port.
This handy mechanism is built into all modern PC operating systems. However,
the way you open a serial port, set line settings, and start speaking serial
are very different between Microsoft Windows and POSIX based platforms. This
library and program bridges the differences between the two APIs and supplies
a console tool for making communication in scripts much simpler.

Example (Windows):

  $ echo "V" | cdctool COM4
  Bumble-B 0.4 (userial 1.6)
  
Example (Linux):

  $ echo "V" | cdctool /dev/ttyACM0
  Bumble-B 0.4 (userial 1.6)


-----------------
COMMAND LINE TOOL
-----------------

`cdctool` is a command line tool. See `cdctool --help` for details on 
program usage. cdctool is a wrapper for the functions in libcdctool.


-------
LIBRARY
-------

`libcdctool` is the C library that `cdctool` uses. It is separated from the
cdctool command line tool so other applications can take advantage of this
cross-platform code.

Run `make doxygen-doc` and look at ./lib/doc/index.html for API documentation.

--------
BUILDING
--------
On most platforms, cdctool can be built with:

./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install

NOTE: To build this package in Windows, you will need to use MinGW32 compiler
with popt. Cygwin is NOT supported since the -mno-cygwin option refuses to work
with gnulib.
